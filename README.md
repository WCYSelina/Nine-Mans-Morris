# Nine Mens Morris
## Project Details

**Objective:**

- The objective of this project is to create a fully-functional, terminal-based version of the classic board game Nine Men's Morris. Our goal is to replicate the traditional gameplay experience within a command-line interface, allowing for intuitive user interactions and strategic play without the need for a graphical user interface. This project aims to provide an accessible, text-based game that challenges players to think critically and plan ahead, while also offering a nostalgic return to the simplicity of classic games.
